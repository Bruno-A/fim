# Fim
File Integrity Manager
============

## Introduction

Fim manage the integrity of a complete file tree.

Ensuring the integrity of a files can be done in both ways. Either you manage your files using a VCS or DVCS.
Or you put all your file into an archive that will ensure the integrity of all the files.
When you have gigabytes of videos or photos or other binary files you cannot put all of them into an archive.
And managing them into a VCS or DVCS is perhaps not good because of the size.
The solution provided by Fim is to manage an index of the files that contains the filename,
the modification date and the SHA-512 signature of all files.
This index is called a State and acts like the Central Directory does for a Zip file.
All the data generated by Fim is stored into the .fim root directory.

You can use Fim to ensure the integrity of a big amount of data files.
This means being sure that no file have been removed, corrupted, modified, renamed, duplicated.
You can also easily detect duplicates to be able to remove them.

Fim does not keep track of the different contents of the files that are managed,
this is why we can call it an Unversioned Control System (UVCS).
Fim keeps only the different State versions.
You cannot use them to retrieve the content of one file that you may have lost.
So using Fim does not prevent you to use a backup.
You can also easily detect duplicates to be able to remove them.
