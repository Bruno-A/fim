== Build Fim

You can build Fim yourself to try the master version.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Fim comes with versioned prebuilt release. I recommend to use them as they are OK to be used. +
If you clone Fim's master, a SNAPSHOT is retrieved and there is no guarantee that this particular build of Fim will work properly.
====

* Get the code
** Download the https://github.com/evrignaud/fim/zipball/master[.zip] or the https://github.com/evrignaud/fim/tarball/master[.tar.gz]
** or clone it using either `https://github.com/evrignaud/fim.git` or `git@github.com:evrignaud/fim.git`
* build it by typing the following command (follow <<how-can-you-use-fim.adoc#_step_by_step_procedure,this procedure>> for more details):

[source]
----
mvn clean install
----

* You can run the jar file generated into the `target` directory using
the two shell script files located in the root directory.

** `fim` for Linux or Mac OS X
** `fim.bat` for Windows

It generates also two distribution files into the `target/dist` directory.

[source]
----
$ ls -a1 target/dist/
fim-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT-distribution.tar.gz
fim-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT-distribution.zip
----

=== Step by step procedure

Here are some tips on how you can build Fim easily.

==== Getting Maven

If you don't have Maven, you can either download it from http://maven.apache.org/index.html[the Apache website] or use a packages manager.

===== For Linux

[source]
----
$ sudo apt-get install maven
----

===== For Mac OS X

First install http://brew.sh[Homebrew] if you don't have it.

[source]
----
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
----

Then install Maven.

[source]
----
$ brew install maven

Then you need to add the `maven/bin` directory into your `PATH`.
