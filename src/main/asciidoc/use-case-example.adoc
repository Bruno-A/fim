= Use case example

Fim can be used for different kind of use cases. +
Personally I use Fim to manage my photos and videos.
When I have new photos, I put them at the right place in my pictures folder and then I do `fim&nbsp;ci` from the sub-directory
containing the new photos to record a new State, as I could do with Git.
As I do this from a sub-directory the commit is fast because Fim hashes only the files that I added and creates a new State
by merging those new hash with the previous State.

More details on using Fim from a sub-directory can be found <<faq.adoc#_run_fim_commands_from_a_sub_directory,here>>.

The `fim diff` command let me know when I want (even super quickly) if something changed in my pictures folder.

I can easily identify and delete the photos I have duplicated on my drive or other computer with the command `fim rdup`.
For this, I just need to copy the `.fim` directory on the other computer.
