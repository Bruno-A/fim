= How can I use Fim

== Fim releases

You can find prebuilt releases of Fim https://github.com/evrignaud/fim/releases[here]

== Building Fim

You can build yourself Fim to try the master version.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Fim comes with versioned prebuilt release. I recommend to use them as they are ok to be used. +
When you make a clone of the master of Fim, a SNAPSHOT is retrieved and there is no guarantee that this particular build of Fim will work properly.
====

* Get the code
** Download the https://github.com/evrignaud/fim/zipball/master[.zip] or the https://github.com/evrignaud/fim/tarball/master[.tar.gz]
** or clone it using either `https://github.com/evrignaud/fim.git` or `git@github.com:evrignaud/fim.git`
* build it by typing the following command:

[source]
-----------------
mvn clean install
-----------------

* You can run the jar file generated into the `target` directory using
the two shell script files located in the root directory.

** `fim` for Linux or Mac OS X
** `fim.bat` for Windows

== Build a Fim distribution

If you want to generate a Fim distribution type the following command:

It generates two distribution files into the `target/dist` directory.
