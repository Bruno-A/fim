= How does it works

Fim manages an index of the files that are managed. It contains for each
file:

* file name
* file length
* modification date
* hash of the second 4 KB block of the file content
* hash of the second 1 MB block of the file content
* hash of the full file content

Most of the files contains headers, so to produce accurate hash of 4 KB
/ 1 MB blocs we skip the first block and hash the second one, **but when
the file size is less than twice the block size we hash the first
block**.

The hash algorithm that is used is SHA-512.

This index is called a `State` and acts like the Central Directory does
for a Zip file. All the data generated by Fim is stored into the `.fim`
root directory.

Fim keeps each version of the different State that have been committed.
You cannot use them to retrieve the content of one file that you may
have lost.


NOTE: *Fim does not replace a backup software*
